# HackShare

A web app where fellows can teach other fellows the skills they believe they are good at.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

- [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/)

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

```

This will grab a local copy of repo

Starting the development server...
Compiled successfully!

You can now view client in the browser.

  Local:            http://localhost:3000

Note that the development build is not optimized.
To create a production build, use yarn build.
```

- Open project again in another terminal and run

```
cd server
npm start
```

This will start NodeJs Application

```
