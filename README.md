# HackShare

A web app where fellows can teach other fellows the skills they believe they are good at.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

- [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Mongo Compass](https://www.mongodb.com/products/compass) - Optional

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

- Open Terminal and run

```
git clone https://github.com/eKhattak/hackshare.git
```

This will grab a local copy of repo

- Open project directory in terminal

```
cd client
npm start
```

This will start React Application

```
Starting the development server...
Compiled successfully!

You can now view client in the browser.

  Local:            http://localhost:3000
  On Your Network:  http://192.168.10.6:3000

Note that the development build is not optimized.
To create a production build, use yarn build.
```

- Open project again in another terminal and run

```
cd server
npm start
```

This will start NodeJs Application

```

[nodemon] to restart at any time, enter `rs`
[nodemon] watching path(s): *.*
